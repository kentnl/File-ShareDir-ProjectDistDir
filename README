NAME
    File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir - Simple set-and-forget using of a
    '/share' directory in your projects root

VERSION
    version 1.000000

SYNOPSIS
      package An::Example::Package;

      use File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir;

      # during development, $dir will be $projectroot/share
      # but once installed, it will be wherever File::Sharedir thinks it is.
      my $dir = dist_dir('An-Example')

    Project layout requirements:

      $project/
      $project/lib/An/Example/Package.pm
      $project/share/   # files for package 'An-Example' go here.

    You can use a directory name other than 'share' ( Assuming you make sure
    when you install that, you specify the different directory there also )
    as follows:

      use File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir ':all', defaults => {
        projectdir => 'templates',
      };

METHODS
  import
        use File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir (@args);

    This uses "Sub::Exporter" to do the heavy lifting, so most usage of this
    module can be maximized by understanding that first.

    *   ":all"

            ->import( ':all' , .... )

        Import both "dist_dir" and "dist_file"

    *   "dist_dir"

            ->import('dist_dir' , .... )

        Import the dist_dir method

    *   "dist_dir"

            ->import('dist_file' , .... )

        Import the dist_file method

    *   "projectdir"

            ->import( .... , projectdir => 'share' )

        Specify what the project directory is as a path relative to the base
        of your distributions source, and this directory will be used as a
        "ShareDir" simulation path for the exported methods *During
        development*.

        If not specified, the default value 'share' is used.

    *   "filename"

            ->import( .... , filename => 'some/path/to/foo.pm' );

        Generally you don't want to set this, as its worked out by caller()
        to work out the name of the file its being called from. This file's
        path is walked up to find the 'lib' element with a sibling of the
        name of your "projectdir".

    *   "distname"

            ->import( .... , distname => 'somedistname' );

        Specifying this argument changes the way the functions are emitted
        at *installed "runtime"*, so that instead of taking the standard
        arguments File::ShareDir does, the specification of the "distname"
        in those functions is eliminated.

        i.e:

            # without this flag
            use File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir qw( :all );

            my $dir = dist_dir('example');
            my $file = dist_file('example', 'path/to/file.pm' );

            # with this flag
            use File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir ( qw( :all ), distname => 'example' );

            my $dir = dist_dir();
            my $file = dist_file('path/to/file.pm' );

    *   "strict"

            ->import( ... , strict => 1 );

        This parameter specifies that all "dist" "sharedirs" will occur
        within the "projectdir" directory using the following layout:

            <root>/<projectdir>/dist/<DISTNAME>/

        As opposed to

            <root>/<projectdir>

        This means if Heuristics misfire and accidentally find another
        distributions "share" directory, it will not pick up on it unless
        that "share" dir also has that layout, and will instead revert to
        the "installdir" path in @INC

        This parameter may become the default option in the future

        Specifying this parameter also mandates you MUST declare the
        "DISTNAME" value in your file somewhere. Doing otherwise is
        considered insanity anyway.

    *   "defaults"

            ->import( ... , defaults => {
                filename => ....,
                projectdir => ....,
            });

        This is mostly an alternative syntax for specifying "filename" and
        "projectdir", which is mostly used internally, and their
        corresponding other values are packed into this one.

   Sub::Exporter tricks of note.
   Make your own sharedir util
        package Foo::Util;

        sub import {
            my ($caller_class, $caller_file, $caller_line )  = caller();
            if ( grep { /share/ } @_ ) {
                require File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir;
                File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir->import(
                    filename => $caller_file,
                    dist_dir => { distname => 'myproject' , -as => 'share' },
                    dist_dir => { distname => 'otherproject' , -as => 'other_share' , projectdir => 'share2' },
                    -into => $caller_class,
                );
            }
        }

        ....

        package Foo;
        use Foo::Util qw( share );

        my $dir = share();
        my $other_dir => other_share();

  build_dist_dir
        use File::ShareDir::ProjectDirDir ( : all );

        #  this calls
        my $coderef = File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir->build_dist_dir(
          'dist_dir' => {},
          { defaults => { filename => 'path/to/yourcallingfile.pm', projectdir => 'share' } }
        );

        use File::ShareDir::ProjectDirDir ( qw( :all ), distname => 'example-dist' );

        #  this calls
        my $coderef = File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir->build_dist_dir(
          'dist_dir' => {},
          { distname => 'example-dist', defaults => { filename => 'path/to/yourcallingfile.pm', projectdir => 'share' } }
        );

        use File::ShareDir::ProjectDirDir
          dist_dir => { distname => 'example-dist', -as => 'mydistdir' },
          dist_dir => { distname => 'other-dist',   -as => 'otherdistdir' };

        # This calls
        my $coderef = File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir->build_dist_dir(
          'dist_dir',
          { distname => 'example-dist' },
          { defaults => { filename => 'path/to/yourcallingfile.pm', projectdir => 'share' } },
        );
        my $othercoderef = File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir->build_dist_dir(
          'dist_dir',
          { distname => 'other-dist' },
          { defaults => { filename => 'path/to/yourcallingfile.pm', projectdir => 'share' } },
        );

        # And leverages Sub::Exporter to create 2 subs in your package.

    Generates the exported 'dist_dir' method. In development environments,
    the generated method will return a path to the development directories
    'share' directory. In non-development environments, this simply returns
    "File::ShareDir::dist_dir".

    As a result of this, specifying the Distribution name is not required
    during development ( unless in "strict" mode ), however, it will start
    to matter once it is installed. This is a potential avenues for bugs if
    you happen to name it wrong.

    In "strict" mode, the distribution name is ALWAYS REQUIRED, either at
    least at "import" or "dist_dir()" time.

  build_dist_file
        use File::ShareDir::ProjectDirDir ( : all );

        #  this calls
        my $coderef = File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir->build_dist_file(
          'dist_file' => {},
          { defaults => { filename => 'path/to/yourcallingfile.pm', projectdir => 'share' } }
        );

        use File::ShareDir::ProjectDirDir ( qw( :all ), distname => 'example-dist' );

        #  this calls
        my $coderef = File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir->build_dist_file(
          'dist_file' => {},
          { distname => 'example-dist', defaults => { filename => 'path/to/yourcallingfile.pm', projectdir => 'share' } }
        );

        use File::ShareDir::ProjectDirDir
          dist_file => { distname => 'example-dist', -as => 'mydistfile' },
          dist_file => { distname => 'other-dist',   -as => 'otherdistfile' };

        # This calls
        my $coderef = File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir->build_dist_file(
          'dist_file',
          { distname => 'example-dist' },
          { defaults => { filename => 'path/to/yourcallingfile.pm', projectdir => 'share' } },
        );
        my $othercoderef = File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir->build_dist_file(
          'dist_file',
          { distname => 'other-dist' },
          { defaults => { filename => 'path/to/yourcallingfile.pm', projectdir => 'share' } },
        );

        # And leverages Sub::Exporter to create 2 subs in your package.

    Generates the 'dist_file' method.

    In development environments, the generated method will return a path to
    the development directories 'share' directory. In non-development
    environments, this simply returns "File::ShareDir::dist_file".

    Caveats as a result of package-name as stated in "build_dist_dir" also
    apply to this method.

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES
  1.000000
   Strict Mode.
   Using Strict Mode
        use File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir ':all', strict => 1;
        use File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir 'dist_dir' => { defaults => { strict => 1 }};

   Why you should use strict mode
    Starting with 1.000000, there is a parameter "strict" that changes how
    sharedir resolution performs.

    Without strict:

        lib/...
        share/...

    With strict

        lib/...
        share/dist/Dist-Name-Here/...

    This technique greatly builds resilience to the long standing problem
    with "develop" vs "install" heuristic ambiguity.

    Here at least,

        dist_dir('Dist-Name')

    Will instead fall back to

        @INC/auto/share/dist/Dist-Name

    When

        share/dist/Dist-Name

    Does not exist.

    This means if you have a layout like this:

        <DEVROOT>/inc/<a local::lib path here>
        <DEVROOT>/lib/<development files here>

    Then when "Foo-Bar-Baz" is installed as:

        <DEVROOT>/inc/lib/Foo/Bar/Baz.pm
        <DEVROOT>/inc/lib/auto/share/dist/Foo-Bar-Baz

    Then "Baz.pm" will not see the "DEVROOT" and assume "Hey, this is
    development" and then proceed to try finding files in "DEVROOT/share"

    Instead, "DEVROOT" must have "DEVROOT/share/dist/Foo-Bar-Baz" too,
    otherwise it reverts to "DEVROOT/inc/lib/auto..."

   "Path::Class" interfaces deprecated and dependency dropped.
    If you have any dependence on this function, now is the time to get
    yourself off it.

   Minimum Changes to stay with "Path::Class" short term.
    As the dependency has been dropped on "Path::Class", if you have "CPAN"
    modules relying on "Path::Class" interface, you should now at a very
    minimum start declaring

        { requires => "Path::Class" }

    This will keep your dist working, but will not be future proof against
    futher changes.

   Staying with "Path::Class" long term.
    Recommended approach if you want to stay using the "Path::Class"
    interface:

        use File::ShareDir::... etc
        use Path::Class qw( dir file );

        my $dir = dir( dist_dir('Dist-Name') );

    This should future-proof you against anything File::ShareDir may do in
    the future.

   "Versioning Scheme arbitrary converted to float"
    This change is a superficial one, and should have no bearing on how
    significant you think this release is.

    It is a significant release, but the primary reason for the version
    change is simply to avoid compatibility issues in *versions themselves*.

    However, outside that, "x.y.z" semantics are still intended to be
    semi-meaningful, just with less "." and more 0 ☺

   "dev" path determination now deferred to call time instead of "use"
    This was essentially a required change to make "strict" mode plausible,
    because strict mode _requires_ the distname to be known, even in the
    development enviroment.

    This should not have any user visible effects, but please, if you have
    any problems, file a bug.

   "file" component determination wrested from "File::ShareDir".
        dist_file('foo','bar')

    Is now simply sugar syntax for

        path(dist_dir('foo'))->child('bar')

    This should have no side effects in your code, but please file any bugs
    you experience.

    ( return value is still undef if the file does not exist, and still
    "croak"'s if the file is not a file, or unreadable, but these may both
    be subject to change )

  0.5.0 - Heuristics and Return type changes
   New "devdir" heuristic
    Starting with 0.5.0, instead of using our simple "lib/../share" pattern
    heuristic, a more advanced heuristic is used from the new
    "Path::FindDev" and "Path::IsDev".

    This relies on a more "concrete" marker somewhere at the top of your
    development tree, and more importantly, checks for the existence of
    specific files that are not likely to occur outside a project root.

    "lib" and "share" based heuristics were a little fragile, for a few
    reasons:

    *   "lib" can, and does appear all over UNIX file systems, for purposes
        other than development project roots.

        For instance, have a look in "/usr/"

            /usr/bin
            /usr/lib
            /usr/share  ## UHOH.

        This would have the very bad side effect of anything installed in
        "/usr/lib" thinking its "in development".

        Fortunately, nobody seems to have hit this specific bug, which I
        suspect is due only to "/usr/lib" being a symbolic link on most
        x86_64 systems.

    *   "lib" is also reasonably common within "CPAN" package names.

        For instance:

            lib::abs

        Which means you'll have a hierarchy like:

            $PREFIX/lib/lib/abs

        All you need for something to go horribly wrong would be for
        somebody to install a "CPAN" module named:

            share::mystuff

        Or similar, and instantly, you have:

            $PREFIX/lib/lib/
            $PREFIX/lib/share/

        Which would mean any module calling itself "lib::*" would be unable
        to use this module.

    So instead, as of 0.5.0, the heuristic revolves around certain specific
    files being in the "dev" directory.

    Which is hopefully a more fault resilient mechanism.

   New Return Types
    Starting with 0.5.0, the internals are now based on "Path::Tiny" instead
    of "Path::Class", and as a result, there may be a few glitches in
    transition.

    Also, previously you could get a "Path::Class::*" object back from
    "dist_dir" and "dist_file" by importing it as such:

        use File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir
            qw( dist_dir dist_file ),
            defaults => { pathclass => 1 };

    Now you can also get "Path::Tiny" objects back, by passing:

        use File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir
            qw( dist_dir dist_file ),
            defaults => { pathtiny => 1 };

    For the time being, you can still get Path::Class objects back, it is
    deprecated since 1.000000

    ( In fact, I may even make 2 specific sub-classes of "PDD" for people
    who want objects back, as it will make the "API" and the code much
    cleaner )
