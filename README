NAME
    File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir - Simple set-and-forget using of a
    '/share' directory in your projects root

VERSION
    version 0.4.5

SYNOPSIS
      package An::Example::Package;

      use File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir;

      # during development, $dir will be $projectroot/share
      # but once installed, it will be wherever File::Sharedir thinks it is.
      my $dir = dist_dir('An-Example')

    Project layout requirements:

      $project/
      $project/lib/An/Example/Package.pm
      $project/share/   # files for package 'An-Example' go here.

    You can use a directory name other than 'share' ( Assuming you make sure
    when you install that, you specify the different directory there also )
    as follows:

      use File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir ':all', defaults => {
        projectdir => 'templates',
      };

METHODS
  import
        use File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir (@args);

    This uses "Sub::Exporter" to do the heavy lifting, so most usage of this
    module can be maximised by understanding that first.

    *   ":all"

            ->import( ':all' , .... )

        Import both "dist_dir" and "dist_file"

    *   "dist_dir"

            ->import('dist_dir' , .... )

        Import the dist_dir method

    *   "dist_dir"

            ->import('dist_file' , .... )

        Import the dist_file method

    *   "projectdir"

            ->import( .... , projectdir => 'share' )

        Specify what the project directory is as a path relative to the base
        of your distributions source, and this directory will be used as a
        "ShareDir" simulation path for the exported methods *During
        development*.

        If not specified, the default value 'share' is used.

    *   "filename"

            ->import( .... , filename => 'some/path/to/foo.pm' );

        Generally you don't want to set this, as its worked out by caller()
        to work out the name of the file its being called from. This file's
        path is walked up to find the 'lib' element with a sibling of the
        name of your "projectdir".

    *   "distname"

            ->import( .... , distname => 'somedistname' );

        Specifying this argument changes the way the functions are emitted
        at *installed "runtime"*, so that instead of taking the standard
        arguments File::ShareDir does, the specification of the "distname"
        in those functions is eliminated.

        i.e:

            # without this flag
            use File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir qw( :all );

            my $dir = dist_dir('example');
            my $file = dist_file('example', 'path/to/file.pm' );

            # with this flag
            use File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir ( qw( :all ), distname => 'example' );

            my $dir = dist_dir();
            my $file = dist_file('path/to/file.pm' );

    *   "defaults"

            ->import( ... , defaults => {
                filename => ....,
                projectdir => ....,
            });

        This is mostly an alternative syntax for specifying "filename" and
        "projectdir", which is mostly used internally, and their
        corresponding other values are packed into this one.

   Sub::Exporter tricks of note.
   Make your own sharedir util
        package Foo::Util;

        sub import {
            my ($caller_class, $caller_file, $caller_line )  = caller();
            if ( grep { /share/ } @_ ) {
                require File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir;
                File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir->import(
                    filename => $caller_file,
                    dist_dir => { distname => 'myproject' , -as => 'share' },
                    dist_dir => { distname => 'otherproject' , -as => 'other_share' , projectdir => 'share2' },
                    -into => $caller_class,
                );
            }
        }

        ....

        package Foo;
        use Foo::Util qw( share );

        my $dir = share();
        my $other_dir => other_share();

  build_dist_dir
        use File::ShareDir::ProjectDirDir ( : all );

        #  this calls
        my $coderef = File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir->build_dist_dir(
          'dist_dir' => {},
          { defaults => { filename => 'path/to/yourcallingfile.pm', projectdir => 'share' } }
        );

        use File::ShareDir::ProjectDirDir ( qw( :all ), distname => 'example-dist' );

        #  this calls
        my $coderef = File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir->build_dist_dir(
          'dist_dir' => {},
          { distname => 'example-dist', defaults => { filename => 'path/to/yourcallingfile.pm', projectdir => 'share' } }
        );

        use File::ShareDir::ProjectDirDir
          dist_dir => { distname => 'example-dist', -as => 'mydistdir' },
          dist_dir => { distname => 'other-dist',   -as => 'otherdistdir' };

        # This calls
        my $coderef = File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir->build_dist_dir(
          'dist_dir',
          { distname => 'example-dist' },
          { defaults => { filename => 'path/to/yourcallingfile.pm', projectdir => 'share' } },
        );
        my $othercoderef = File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir->build_dist_dir(
          'dist_dir',
          { distname => 'other-dist' },
          { defaults => { filename => 'path/to/yourcallingfile.pm', projectdir => 'share' } },
        );

        # And leverages Sub::Exporter to create 2 subs in your package.

    Generates the exported 'dist_dir' method. In development environments,
    the generated method will return a path to the development directories
    'share' directory. In non-development environments, this simply returns
    "File::ShareDir::dist_dir".

    As a result of this, specifying the Distribution name is not required
    during development, however, it will start to matter once it is
    installed. This is a potential avenues for bugs if you happen to name it
    wrong.

  build_dist_file
        use File::ShareDir::ProjectDirDir ( : all );

        #  this calls
        my $coderef = File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir->build_dist_file(
          'dist_file' => {},
          { defaults => { filename => 'path/to/yourcallingfile.pm', projectdir => 'share' } }
        );

        use File::ShareDir::ProjectDirDir ( qw( :all ), distname => 'example-dist' );

        #  this calls
        my $coderef = File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir->build_dist_file(
          'dist_file' => {},
          { distname => 'example-dist', defaults => { filename => 'path/to/yourcallingfile.pm', projectdir => 'share' } }
        );

        use File::ShareDir::ProjectDirDir
          dist_file => { distname => 'example-dist', -as => 'mydistfile' },
          dist_file => { distname => 'other-dist',   -as => 'otherdistfile' };

        # This calls
        my $coderef = File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir->build_dist_file(
          'dist_file',
          { distname => 'example-dist' },
          { defaults => { filename => 'path/to/yourcallingfile.pm', projectdir => 'share' } },
        );
        my $othercoderef = File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir->build_dist_file(
          'dist_file',
          { distname => 'other-dist' },
          { defaults => { filename => 'path/to/yourcallingfile.pm', projectdir => 'share' } },
        );

        # And leverages Sub::Exporter to create 2 subs in your package.

    Generates the 'dist_file' method.

    In development environments, the generated method will return a path to
    the development directories 'share' directory. In non-development
    environments, this simply returns "File::ShareDir::dist_file".

    Caveats as a result of package-name as stated in "build_dist_dir" also
    apply to this method.

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES
  0.5.0 - Heuristics and Return type changes
   New "devdir" heuristic
    Starting with 0.5.0, instead of using our simple "lib/../share" pattern
    heuristic, a more advanced heuristic is used from the new
    "Path::FindDev" and "Path::IsDev".

    This relies on a more "concrete" marker somewhere at the top of your
    development tree, and more importantly, checks for the existence of
    specific files that are not likely to occur outside a project root.

    "lib" and "share" based heuristics were a little fragile, for a few
    reasons:

    *   "lib" can, and does appear all over unix file systems, for purposes
        other than development project roots.

        For instance, have a look in "/usr/"

            /usr/bin
            /usr/lib
            /usr/share  ## UHOH.

        This would have the very bad side effect of anything installed in
        "/usr/lib" thinking its "in development".

        Fortunately, nobody seems to have hit this specific bug, which I
        suspect is due only to "/usr/lib" being a symlink on most x86_64
        systems.

    *   "lib" is also reasonably common within "CPAN" package names.

        For instance:

            lib::abs

        Which means you'll have a heirarchy like:

            $PREFIX/lib/lib/abs

        All you need for something to go horribly wrong would be for
        somebody to install a "CPAN" module named:

            share::mystuff

        Or similar, and instantly, you have:

            $PREFIX/lib/lib/
            $PREFIX/lib/share/

        Which would mean any module calling itself "lib::*" would be unable
        to use this module.

        So instead, as of 0.5.0, the heuristic revolves around certain
        specific files being in the "dev" directory.

        Which is hopefully a more fault resilient mechanism.

   New Return Types
    Starting with 0.5.0, the internals are now based on "Path::Tiny" instead
    of "Path::Class", and as a result, there may be a few glitches in
    transition.

    Also, previously you could get a "Path::Class::*" object back from
    "dist_dir" and "dist_file" by importing it as such:

        use File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir
            qw( dist_dir dist_file ),
            defaults => { pathclass => 1 };

    Now you can also get "Path::Tiny" objects back, by passing:

        use File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir
            qw( dist_dir dist_file ),
            defaults => { pathtiny => 1 };

    For the time being, you can still get Path::Class objects back, but its
    likely to be deprecated in future.

    ( In fact, I may even make 2 specific subclasses of PDD for people who
    want objects back, as it will make the API and the code much cleaner )
