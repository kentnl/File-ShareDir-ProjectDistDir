0.4.2 2013-05-23T17:11:31Z
 [Bug Fixes]
 - workaround for a user-installation that created a 'share' dir as a
   sibling of a 'lib' dir, which falsely lead us to believe the 'lib' dir
   was a "development lib dir", caused by a user installing ImageMagic
   wrongly.
 - This is only really a temporary solution, in lieu of better debugging
   diagnostics.

0.3.2 2012-05-07T17:07:54Z
 [Bugs]
 - github#2 There was a bug on some platforms where
   Path::Class::Dir->new('/')->parent->dir_list() returned a 2-item list
   instead of a one-item list which was our loop termination criteria. This
   became an infinite death loop on all platforms that have a "volume" (
   mac, win ). Has been resolved by performing a check to see if the path
   is the OS Specific path that represents a "root" from
   File::Spec->rootdir. Feedback on if this works or not requested, and if
   this still is a problem, I'll use $dir->parent eq $dir being the loop
   terminator.

 [Dependencies::Changed / develop recommends]
 - Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::KENTNL::Lite 0.01009803 → v1.3.0

 [Dependencies::Changed / develop suggests]
 - Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::KENTNL v1.2.0 → v1.3.0

0.3.1 2012-03-07T03:57:06Z
 [00 Summary]
 - Dropping 5.10.0 dependency back to 5.006 due to github#1. Apparently
   there is a sustainable way to use decimal versions in <=5.10.0 reliably
   via 'use version', so this is somewhat experimental consideration of
   that fact.

 [Dependencies::Changed / runtime requires]
 - perl v5.10.0 → 5.006

0.3.0 2012-03-05T05:27:43Z
 [00 Noteworthy Changes]
 - New 'distname' parameter
 - greatly enhanced documentation
 - supports 'projectdir' on a per-export level.

 [Dependencies::Added / runtime requires]
 - perl v5.10.0

 [Dependencies::Changed / develop suggests]
 - Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::KENTNL v1.0.0 → v1.2.0

 [Documentation]
 - verbosely detailed the workings of the import method and its helper
   methods.

 [Features]
 - new experimental support for a 'distname' parameter.
 - per export support for 'projectdir' allowing >1 dist_dir method to be
   exported.

 [Packaging]
 - Update LICENSE ( Year, Indentation )

 [Tests::New]
 - release/minimum-version.t
 - t/06_distname.t

0.2.0 2011-10-15T02:08:29Z
 [Dependencies::Added / runtime requires]
 - strict
 - warnings

 [Dependencies::Removed / test requires]
 - English

 [Features]
 - Custom Project Dir:
 - Can now support passing a directory other than 'share' to use in your
   project.
 - eg: use File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir qw( :all ), projectdir =>
   'templates';
 - Thank Getty/Torsten Raudssus for requesting this feature.

 [Internals]
 - $VERSION is no longer set during BEGIN ( Dist::Zilla )

 [Packaging]
 - Re-generated License from more recent template ( minor indentation
   changes, change of address )
 - AuthorTests/ReleaseTests no longer stored in t/, no longer do ENV{}
   based mangling, no longer spams you during install, and are now only
   even notable during `dzil release` and `dzil xtest`. ( See
   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CheckExtraTests> for details.
 - All github URL's now point to https:// paths.
 - Now uses Authority plugin to create $AUTHORITY headings and x_authority
   = cpan:KENTNL

 [Tests]
 - New test that tests new syntax for using a custom sharedir name.

0.1.1 2011-04-08T01:29:46Z
